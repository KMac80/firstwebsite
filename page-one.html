            <h1>Journey's Into Internetting!</h1>
            <p>My journey into learning how to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript starts here.</p>

            <h2>The Early Years...</h2>
            <p>My journey actually started just after high school when I joined the U.S. Army at age 18.</p>

            <h2>Practice with lists.</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Put my accomplishments here</li>
                <li>here</li>
                <li>and here...</li>
                <li>don't forget that you can nest paragraphs into lists, but not the other way around</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>This is an ordered list: Use a favorite recipe</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>ingredients, create more as needed</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>First Step</li>
                <li>Second Step</li>
                <li>Third Step, add more as needed</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>This next section will showcase inline elements, emphasizing certain elements</h2>
            <p>Tell a joke, and <em>emphasize the punchline.</em>  <br/>Also <strong>bold</strong> certain elements.</p>

            <p>P.S. the above is a horizontal break</p>
